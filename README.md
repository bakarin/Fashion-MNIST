# Fashion MNIST

In this notebook we build a simple neural network with Tensorflow/Keras.

The dataset is from [Zalando Research](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) and consists of 60,000 training files and 10,000 test files. The images are greyscale and have a size of 28x28. Every image is labeled with one out of 10 classes (trouser, pullover, dress, coat,...)
